## Connect Four

**_Status:_** _playtesting_

Claim neighborhoods with challenges. Secure a line of four neighborhoods to win!

This mode is a strategic dance between two teams. You'll have a hand of challenges, some easy and some hard. You'll need to work out your best path to a line of four, while also guessing where your rivals are trying to go.

Some extra hard challenges can steal opponent's regions, or lock existing regions so they can't be stolen.

## Snake

**_Status:_** _In development_

The greatest game on Nokia now comes to Playground City!

Travel to the "Fruit" and complete a challenge to grow your snake.

To win, completely wrap the other team, trapping their head inside your snake body.

This is a frantic, fast-paced game of chicken where both teams are competing for the same resources, but must dodge each other's wraps!
