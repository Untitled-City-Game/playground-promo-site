## Connect Four

**_Status:_** _Playtesting_

**_Players:_** _4 - 8, in 2 teams_

Claim neighborhoods with challenges. Secure a line of four neighborhoods to win!

This mode is a strategic dance between two teams. You'll have a hand of challenges, some easy and some hard. You'll need to work out your best path to a line of four, while also guessing where your rivals are trying to go.

Some extra hard challenges can steal opponent's regions, or lock existing regions so they can't be stolen.

## Snake

**_Status:_** _In development_

**_Players:_** _4-12, in 2 or 3 teams_

The greatest game on Nokia now comes to Playground City!

Travel to the "Fruit" and complete a challenge to grow your snake.

To win, completely wrap the other team, trapping their head inside your snake body.

This is a frantic, fast-paced game of chicken where both teams are competing for the same resources, but must dodge each other's wraps!

## Tag

**_Status:_** _Planned_

**_Players:_** _8 - 20, in 4 to 10 teams_

Race around the city and avoid being caught!

This mode is our take on the classic game of Tag (or depending where you live, Tiggy, or Chase, or Chasings, or It, or Tips, or On-On).

Four to ten teams maneuver across the map. One or two teams are the **chasers**, who must catch another team to make them "it". The rest of the team are **runners,** trying to escape.

However, runners must pay for transit using **tickets** which are earned by completing challenges. If they can't do challenges quickly, the chasers are bound to catch up and get tagged. They can also earn other challenge rewards, like invisibility or traps.

**Traps** are, area-based effects which both runners and chasers can place. They can slow down or block runners. Chasers get some free traps to help them with the catch, while runners can earn traps to slow down other runners while they escape.

Points are earned based on how long a team are runners - but every time you get caught, a third of your points are given to the chasers. If you're winning, you're the juiciest target on the map!

## Battleship

**_Status:_** _Planned_

Two teams rove around the map trying to locate and destroy the other team. In this game, locations are secret, but can be deduced through a combination of clues and context. It's an explosive game of deduction and paranoia.

As you roam the board, you'll complete challenges to earn **mines,** **torpedoes** and **radar**.

**Radar** can be used to get info on the other team's position.

**Torpedoes** can be launched at a specific location - but you must be within range of the other team, putting you in danger!

**Mines** can be left at a specific location on the map, and detonated later if you think the other team is close by.

Beware - many challenges involve going to specific locations, and **both teams have the same challenges,** making them a perfect location to leave mines or shoot a torpedo!
