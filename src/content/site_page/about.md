## **Dash around town**

Playground City is played in person, using public transit. You'll catch trains, buses or bikes to reach your goals and outmaneuver the other team.

## **Complete fun challenges**

Every game mode comes with unique challenged tailored to your city, as well as generic challenges which work anywhere.

## **Strategize to win**

The entire city map becomes your board. You can see zones and objectives update in real time, and follow the other team's location to predict their next move.
