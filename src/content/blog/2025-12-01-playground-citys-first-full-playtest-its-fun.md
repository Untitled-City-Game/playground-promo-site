Yesterday I and three very dedicated playtesters braved the Montreal snow for the first full gameplay test of the Playground City beta. Turns out, the game is fun! In this post I'm going to explain what we tested, what we found out, and how we're going to make the game better.

We played Connect 4, the first [game mode](/games) in the app. This game is just like traditional Connect 4, except each slot is an entire neighbourhood of the city, and you claim a neighbourhood by going there and doing a challenge.

## Too Many Insta-win Challenges

In our game, Red team (my team) leapt out of the gate by claiming 3 neighbourhoods in a row before Blue got any.

This was mostly because we started with three really quick challenges - Write an Ode to the Other Team, Create a Sign Haiku, and Go Somewhere Nice.

These challenges aren't all _easy_, but if you do good, or get lucky, they can be really _fast._

This is a super important lesson for challenge design. If too many challenges can be completed in less than a minute, a team can potentially swipe a victory before the other team has a chance to react.

I'm going to update the challenges so there are more with an unavoidable time commitment. This has the added bonus of adding more downtime to the game. Challenges are meant to be fun, and if they take a little longer, players don't feel as stressed out about logistics and strategy.

## Connect Four is a fast game!

I scheduled 3 hours for this test, and I worried the game might take longer. This game, though, took only 1 hour and 45 minutes. That's quite fast even for a regular board game, let alone one where you travel across the entire city!

Now, it didn't _have_ to be so quick. We had a nail-biter ending, where Red team rushed across town to block Blue from finishing a line. The Blue team barely got there first, but if Red had succeeded, the game could easily have gone for another hour.

However, nobody was sad about the early finish! It was a thrilling game end, and everyone felt the victory was earned by the strategic decisions of both teams, even if it could easily have gone the other way.

This really cemented the decision to have Connect 4 be the first/default game mode. I'm very confident other modes will take longer to play, some potentially all day.
