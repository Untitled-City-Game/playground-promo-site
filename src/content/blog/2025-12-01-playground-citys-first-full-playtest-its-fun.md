Yesterday I and three very dedicated playtesters braved the Montreal snow for the first full gameplay test of the Playground City beta. Turns out, the game is fun! In this post I'm going to explain what we tested, what we found out, and how we're going to make the game better.

## Connect Four is a Quick, Crunchy game.

We played Connect 4, the first [game mode](/games) in the app. This game is just like traditional Connect 4, except each slot is an entire neighbourhood of the city, and you claim a neighbourhood by going there and doing a challenge.
