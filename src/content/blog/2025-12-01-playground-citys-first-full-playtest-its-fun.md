Yesterday I and three very dedicated playtesters braved the Montreal snow for the first full gameplay test of the Playground City beta. Turns out, the game is fun! In this post I'm going to explain what we tested, what we found out, and how we're going to make the game better.

## Lesson the First: Too Many Quick Challenges

We played Connect 4, the first [game mode](/games) in the app. This game is just like traditional Connect 4, except each slot is an entire neighbourhood of the city, and you claim a neighbourhood by going there and doing a challenge.

In our game, Red team (my team) leapt out of the gate by claiming 3 neighbourhoods in a row before Blue got any.

This was mostly because we started with three really quick challenges - Write an Ode to the Other Team, Create a Sign Haiku, and Go Somewhere Nice.

## Lesson the Second: Connect Four is a fast game!

I scheduled 3 hours for this test, and I worried the game might take longer. This game, though, took only 1 hour and 45 minutes. That's quite fast even for a regular board game, let alone one where you travel across the entire city!

Now, it didn't _have_ to be so fast. I'll give you a quick blow-by-blow to explain:
