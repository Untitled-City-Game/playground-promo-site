Yesterday I and three very dedicated playtesters braved the Montreal snow for the first full gameplay test of the Playground City beta. Turns out, the game is fun! In this post I'm going to explain what we tested, what we found out, and how we're going to make the game better.

## Takeaway the First: Connect Four is a Quick Game

We played Connect 4, the first [game mode](/games) in the app. This game is just like traditional Connect 4, except each slot is an entire neighbourhood of the city, and you claim a neighbourhood by going there and doing a challenge.

I scheduled 3 hours for this test, and I worried the game might take longer. This game, though, took only 1 hour and 45 minutes. That's quite fast even for a regular board game, let alone one where you travel across the entire city!

Now, it didn't _have_ to be so fast. I'll give you a quick blow-by-blow to explain.
